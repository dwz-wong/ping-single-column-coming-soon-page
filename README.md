- FontAwesome

### What I learned

- What I have learned in this project or challenge, I have designed similarly to the design provided using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice and improve my front-end skills. Other than that, I learned email validation and used it on my project or challenge.

### Continued development

- I will keep on challenging Frontend Mentor and other challenges or projects, learn new things, practice more, and improve my front-end skills for future challenges or projects.

### Useful resources
